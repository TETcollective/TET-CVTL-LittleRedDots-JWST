## Abstract

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of compact, red sources known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) at $z \gtrsim 5$, hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that appear overmassive relative to their host galaxies. Standard models struggle to explain their rapid growth within the limited cosmic time available. Here, we demonstrate that these objects are direct observational signatures predicted by the TU-GUT-SYSY framework: a unified theory positing a pre-geometric "Big Gang" of entangled topological knots. High-winding-number knots collapse into heavy seed black holes capable of sustained, intrinsic super-Eddington accretion due to residual higher-dimensional gauge-gravitational symmetries (SYSY). Quantitative predictions for seed masses ($10^{4}$--$10^{6}\,M_\odot$), black hole-to-stellar mass ratios (0.1--1), redshift distribution, and spectral properties match JWST observations precisely. The LRDs are not anomalies but the first direct confirmation of primordial topological structure in the Universe.
